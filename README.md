Random String Generator

A simple web-based Random String Generator that allows users to generate random strings based on customizable parameters, such as string length and letter case. This project is built using PHP, HTML, and CSS.
Features

    Customizable String Length: Users can select the length of the generated string, ranging from 1 to 100 characters.
    Case Selection: Choose between:
        Both Uppercase and Lowercase letters
        Only Lowercase letters
        Only Uppercase letters
    Numbers Included: The generated string includes numbers (0-9) by default.
    Responsive Design: The user interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used

    PHP: For backend string generation and processing.
    HTML: For creating the structure of the form and displaying results.
    CSS: For styling the user interface and making it modern and responsive.

How It Works

    User Input: The user specifies the string length and selects the desired case for the string (uppercase, lowercase, or both).
    PHP Logic: When the form is submitted, PHP generates a random string based on the user's inputs.
    String Output: The random string is displayed on the page for the user to copy or use.
    UI: A simple and modern design with easy-to-use form inputs, buttons, and result display.
